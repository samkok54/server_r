1.  Introduction

    The program genomeSIM is a genotype data simulator.  It can simulate
    large-scale genomic data in case-control samples.  genomeSIM utilizes 
    two different methods to generate case-control datasets.  
    
    An initial population can be generated on the basis of allele frequencies 
    of the SNPs and then further generations are created by crossing the 
    members of successive generations.  The simulator assigns affection 
    status only after a specified number of generations.  The end result 
    is a population-dependent number of cases and controls produced from 
    a known number of generations.  
    
    Alternatively, the simulator can construct a case-control dataset by 
    generating individuals as above, assigning affection status, and 
    selecting cases and controls until the dataset is complete.  In this 
    method, the initial population is increased in size (without crossing) 
    until the desired dataset is created.  

2. Examples

    genomeSIM takes 2 arguments.  The first is the name of the configuration file
    and the second is the base name to use in creating output files.  Sample 
    files are at the end of this document.  To run the examples, enter the 
    example directory and run the executable:
    
    ../bin/genomeSIM population.datasim NewPopData
    
    ../bin/genomeSIM prob.datasim NewProbData

a.  Run genomeSIM to produce a dataset that undergoes generations.  In this case
    4000 individuals will undergo 100 generations.  The genome
    will consist of 20 genes that have 5 SNPs per gene for a total of 100 loci.
    SNPs will have a recombination rate between .005 and .05 and have minor
    allele frequencies between 0.05 and 0.5.  The penetrance model is 
    contained in the file sample.smod and all individuals will have their
    status set by it.  The specific frequencies for the penetrance model
    are listed under the ALLELEFREQS keyword.

    model contained in sample.smod.  100 loci will be simulated with minor allele
    frequencies between 0.05 and 0.5.  Loci 5 and 10 are the penetrance model loci
    and have their frequencies specifically set to match the penetrance model.

3.  Input files

    The user must provide a configuration file listing the parameters for 
    use in the program.  Parameters should be capitalized as shown below.  
    Most parameters have default values as indicated.  All parameters should 
    list the parameter name followed by one or more spaces and then the 
    parameter values.  Each parameter should be on its own line.  If the 
    simulation will be using a penetrance table to assign affection status, 
    the user should provide a penetrance table file(s) with the parameters indicated.

                         range.  Used in both probability and 
                         population based simulation.  When it is not used

ALLELEFREQS      none    Specifies the allele frequencies for individual SNPs
                         in the simulation.  The penetrance model loci should
                         be set here to match the frequencies used in generating
                         the model.

                         ('chrom')

b. Penetrance model file parameters

DISEASELOCI      none    Specifies which loci are set as the penetrance 
                         model loci in the simulation
                         
PENTABLE         none    Specifies the penetrance value for each genotype
                         in the penetrance table.  Loci use uppercase letters
                         to represent each locus, so a 3 locus model would
                         have the genotypes AABBCC, AABBCc, AABBcc, etc.
                         Each penetrance value should be specified after
                         the corresponding genotype. (AABBCC 0.010)
                         

4. Algorithms

  a.  Population-based simulation
      
      As a first step, genomeSIM establishes the genome based on the parameters
      in the configuration file.  Keyword GENES specifies the number of genes
      and MINSNP and MAXSNP set the range for the number of SNPs in each gene.
      The simulator then sets the recombination fraction between each SNP
      based on the MINRECOMB and MAXRECOMB values.  All recombination frequencies
      are random and independent.  SNPs are unlinked across genes.
      
      genomeSIM then creates an initial population using the genome created
      above.  The POPTYPE keyword controls the type and behavior of the
      population.  If 'ind' is set, the population consists of individuals
      containing two chromosomes.  Crossing individuals leads to the
      creation of new individuals for the next generation.  If 'chrom' is set,
      the population consists of a pool of chromosomes.  In this case,
      the crosses are conducted between chromosomes that are selected 
      randomly with replacement.  Each cross produces one new chromosome
      for the next generation pool.
      
      In either case, genomeSIM selects one of the 2 chromosomes being
      crossed as the start chromosome and begins copying alleles to the 
      new chromosome.  At every interval between loci, the simulator
      checks the recombination rate against a random number.  If the random
      number is less than the rate, the program switches to the other
      chromosome to copy alleles.  
      
      In each type of population, the size of the population does not vary.
      The simulator continues generating new generations up to the specified
      limit in NUMGENS.  After the last generation, in a 'chrom' population,
      individuals are created by randomly selecting with replacement two
      chromosomes for the pool.  In both types of populations, the penetrance
      table is used to assign affection status by applying a random value
      to the value in the appropriate genotype for the disease loci.


  b.  Probability-based simulation
  
      In this simulation, genomeSIM establishes the genome based on the 
      parameters in the configuration file.  Keyword SIMLOCI specifies
      the number of SNPs to create.  Allele frequencies are set either
      within the range specified by ALLELELIMITS or, if absent, every
      SNP has the frequencies listed by DEFAULTALLLE.  Specific SNP
      allele frequencies are set by the ALLELEFREQS keyword.
      
      genomeSIM then produces individuals until it has the number of
      AFFECTED and UNAFFECTED requested.  Every individual has its
      genotype checked against the penetrance table to assign affection
      status.
  
  

5.  Sample files

a.  Input files
    
    The program takes two types of input files: configuration (.datasim) 
    and penetrance table file (.smod).


.smod file -- The smod file is used in the data simulation software.  Every
model simulated produces a smod file.  The number of the model is incorporated
into the file name.

all the parameters necessary for producing a dataset with the model specified
in the file.

b.  Ouput files

    The program produces multiple output files.  If trios are produced, 
    the genotypes are put into either makeped (.ped) or pre-makeped 
    (.pre) format files.  In all other cases the genotype output is in the 
    standard genoSIM file (.out).  If trios are produced, the locus
    information is placed in the .dat format.  In all other cases,
    the locus information is placed into a .loc file.
    
    The genotype output files have the set number added to the output name.
    If multiple generations have been simulated the generations completed
    is also added.  sample.1.20.out is the first set and the output is based
    on 20 generations.

.out file -- Standard genoSIM genotype data output file.  The first column is 
affection status (1=affected) and all other columns are genotypes.
